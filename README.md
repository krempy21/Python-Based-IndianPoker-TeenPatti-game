# Python-Based Indian Poker (Teen Patti) Game

Welcome to the Python-Based Indian Poker (Teen Patti) Game repository! This project is a simple Python implementation of the popular card game Teen Patti. It compares two hands and declares the winner based on the Teen Patti hand ranks. Please note that this version focuses solely on hand comparison and doesn't include betting mechanics.

## Game Rules

Indian Poker, also known as Teen Patti, is a card game played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The game involves betting and bluffing and is typically played with 3 to 6 players. Each player is dealt three cards, and the objective is to have the best possible hand based on the following ranks, from highest to lowest:

1. Trail/Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank.
2. Pure Sequence: Three consecutive cards of the same suit.
3. Sequence/Normal Run: Three consecutive cards of different suits.
4. Color/Flush: Three cards of the same suit.
5. Pair: Two cards of the same rank, and the third card is unrelated.
6. High Card: None of the above combinations.

This project's goal is to compare two hands and determine the winner based on these hand ranks.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script using a compatible interpreter. For example:

   ```
   python teen_patti_game.py
   ```

4. The script will compare the hands and announce the winner.
